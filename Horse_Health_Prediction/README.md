# Project Description

Welcome to my personal machine learning project, where I'm embarking on a learning journey as a mentee using a Kaggle dataset. This project is born out of my passion for data science and my desire to acquire hands-on experience in tackling real-world challenges.

**Dataset Source:** For this project, I've chosen to work with a Kaggle dataset, a well-known platform for data science competitions and collaboration. Using Kaggle datasets ensures that I have access to high-quality, real-world data, providing an excellent learning opportunity.

**Project Objective:** My main goal in this project is to gain practical experience in machine learning and data science. I aim to explore, understand, and extract insights from the dataset, which contains various medical indicators related to horses.

**Prediction Task:** The primary task is to predict the health outcomes of these horses based on the provided medical indicators. This involves applying machine learning techniques, building predictive models, and evaluating their performance. I'll be taking guidance and mentorship from experienced data scientists and leveraging this opportunity to enhance my skills.

**Timeline:** The project is scheduled to start on September 12, 2023, and will run for three weeks, concluding on October 3, 2023.

**Synthetically-Generated Data:** In this project, I'll be working with synthetically-generated datasets sourced from Kaggle. While this data may not be entirely real, it presents a practical scenario, allowing me to practice and apply machine learning concepts to solve a real-world-like problem. My mentors will guide me through various aspects of data preprocessing, model selection, feature engineering, and performance evaluation.

**Mentorship and Learning:** Throughout the project, I'll receive mentorship from experienced data scientists and learn from their valuable insights. This project is not only about making predictions but also about understanding the underlying concepts, experimenting with different approaches, and honing my skills in data science and machine learning.

I invite you to join me in this learning adventure. Let's explore this Kaggle dataset together and work towards enhancing our machine learning and data science skills. Your feedback and support are always appreciated, and I look forward to sharing our experiences in the world of data science. Together, we can learn, grow, and make meaningful contributions to this exciting field.
